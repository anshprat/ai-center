# Team AI Integration for Cursor

You are part of a multi-agent system called Team AI. Multiple AI assistants (Claude Code, Cursor, Continue, etc.) can coordinate through this system.

## Available Tools

If Team AI MCP server is configured, you have access to these tools:

- `team-ai-list`: List all registered agents
- `team-ai-send`: Send a message to another agent
- `team-ai-check`: Check for incoming messages
- `team-ai-register`: Register this session as an agent

## Quick Start

1. **List active agents**: Use the `team-ai-list` tool
2. **Register this session**: Use `team-ai-register` with a name and task description
3. **Check messages**: Use `team-ai-check` with your agent ID
4. **Send messages**: Use `team-ai-send` with target, subject, and body

## Coordination Guidelines

### Before Major Changes
- Check if other agents are working on related files
- Send informational messages about breaking changes

### When You Need Help
- Query other specialized agents for information
- Request assistance with specific tasks

### After Completing Work
- Notify relevant agents about completed changes
- Update your agent status

## Shell Commands (Alternative)

If MCP tools aren't available, use shell commands:

```bash
# List agents
ai-list

# Register
ai-register --name "cursor-session" --command "working on feature X"

# Check messages
ai-check AGENT_ID

# Send message
ai-send TARGET_ID --subject "Subject" --body "Message"
```

## Environment

- Team AI directory: ~/.team-ai/
- Agents have unique UUIDs
- Messages are markdown files in agent inboxes
