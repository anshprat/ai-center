 I run multiple claude code agents in parallel at times doing different        
  projects. I would like these multiple agents to be able to talk to each other. To start with, lets enabled a ~/.team-ai/ folder, where each agent puts their metadata. This is different from ~/.claude since ~/.team-ai is for end user exposed tracking and cross agents action.

  The metadata in this folder should be
  - one folder per agent / per session
  - each folder contains the name of the folder the agent is running in, the name of the agent, the command, the start time, the latest plan, the latest state etc.
  - Let the agent folder also contain an incoming folder where other agents can pass instructions. Let the incoming folder have sub folders of todo, wip, done.
  - Agent B can send instructions for agent A using ~/.team-ai/agent-A/incoming/todo/agent-B.md
  - Agent A can read, move it to wip when its working upon it and finally move it to done when its done.
  - Identify any other relevant helpful metadata that we can add in this folder.
